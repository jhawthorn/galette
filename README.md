# Galette

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhawthorn/galette.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhawthorn/galette)

Dependency resolution algorithm in ruby.

It could be an alternative to [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) and CocoaPods's [Molinillo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo) algorithm. It's currently just an experiment.

## Implementation

Dependency resolution is a satisfiability problem. In the worst case we would
have to test every possible combination of dependencies to try and find one
which works. It's like a really big and hard sudoku.

In practice, we can hopefully either find a solution quickly or discovering
that the path we're considering is a dead end.

Galette stores dependencies as a bitmap, an integer where each binary digit
represents a version. A dependency being unneeded is considered a special case
at bit 0.

The bitmap is a trade-off: It supports faster bulk operations, like computing
the intersection of two dependencies, at the expense of iterating over versions
being slower. Because we're using large arbitrary precision integers, these
bulk operations are still `O(n)`, but they should be fairly quick and well
optimized. Bitmap are space-efficient, allowing them to be duplicated and used
immutably.

The entire graph of all gems that may be required are precomputed before
resolution starts, which can be slow.

## vs. Bundler

This is, for now, just a fun experiment, but it's inspired by the many problems
I've had with bundler (and its Molinillo backend).
For example
[Bundler 1.15.x was broken](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/5633)
because of a bug in its backtracking (fixed in 1.16), and 
I currently face a [Gemfile which takes 36 minutes to resolve dependencies](https://gist.github.com/jhawthorn/3f91285dd4302307244748eea9c7a634).

Galette is able to resolve the equivalent of that difficult 36 minute Gemfile in under 13 seconds.
I also believe bugs in backtracking would be less likely in Galette's architecture.

Despite some encouraging results, Galette is slower than Bundler/Molinillo in a lot
of cases. I'm also only 70% sure it works at all.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'galette'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install galette

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
